								<h3>Business modeling</h3>
								<p>Using standard design processes such as <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas" terget=0>Canvas</a>, you come to identify the most
            		effective strategy for introducing the desired innovation in your business.</p>
            		<p>The design involves context analysis, requirements definition, value
              	proposition modeling, customer understanding, revenue streams selection, patterns selection, and so on.</p>
              	<p>The outcome of the design phase will describe, up to Pitch Deck and Business Plan,
                the new innovative business model, appropriate to the challenges of the Digital Economy. </p>
							</li>
							<li class="icon fa-sitemap">
								<h3>High-level design</h3>
								<p>Each business model for the Digital Age is based on a specific computer system.
                It automates the operational process that produces the value proposition.</p>
                <p>Using standard software design techniques and tools, it is possible define
                requirements and design the business flow of the software application that meets the business model.</p>
                <p>Outcome of this phase is documentation for the management and technical
                documentation and files that can be used immediately for software development.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="icon fa-tasks">
								<h3>Project management</h3>
								<p>Implementing a new business model is a complex process that needs to be handled strictly.
                It is good practice to design in detail the start-up process in order to be able to quickly trigger the
                expected revenue streams and not raise investment costs.</p>
                <p>The management of the start-up project must be entrusted to staff with deep experience,
                capable of steering all phases, developing and deploying software, and harmonizing IT resources.
                From designing and monitoring the results of the marketing plan, to the monitoring of digital communication.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="icon fa-cogs">
								<h3>Mentoring</h3>
								<p>Resistance to change is an obstacle to innovation.</p>
                <p>To reduce the risk of failure of innovation projects,
                the widely used method is the one based on knowledge transfer and sharing.</p>
                <p>Both in the cases of introducing new business models within
                pre-existing firm and start-ups created specifically around a specific business model,
                the mentoring activity is best suited to climate improvement, cracking down on mistrust
                and minimizing cultural gaps.</p>
